# learn

personal project to keep all my daily Japanese learnig stuff into a single place

- [x] random vocabulary with audio synthesis
- [ ] grammar lessons
- [ ] random order phrases to re order
- [x] audio recognition 
- [ ] mix of everythings

**Notes**

 at this moment, recognition is not recognizing correctly what's said by the users. I'll take more time to check usage of ```SFSpeechRecognizer``` later on
